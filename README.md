# Sentiment-Analysis-Assessment-
##Project Summary.  
This project aims to evaluate the accuracy of the following to methods, Zero-Shot-Topic Classification and traditional Sentiment Analysis, on a binary sentiment analysis task.  
It will use two benchmarks 1.Naver sentiment Movie Corpus v1.0 (https://github.com/e9t/nsmc#naver-sentiment-movie-corpus-v10) and 2. Toxic Comment Data (https://github.com/songys/Toxic_comment_data) as benchmarks to evalute the accuracy of the two methods. I purpose to proove that Zero-Shot-Topic Classification is a flawless, sometimes better off alternative compared to the traditional Sentiment Analysis technique.
