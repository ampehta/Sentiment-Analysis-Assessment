# Sentiment-Analysis-Assessment-
## Project Summary.  
This project aims to evaluate the accuracy of the following to methods, Zero-Shot-Topic Classification and traditional Sentiment Analysis, on a binary sentiment analysis task.  

It will use two benchmarks  
*1.Naver sentiment Movie Corpus v1.0* (https://github.com/e9t/nsmc#naver-sentiment-movie-corpus-v10)   
*2. Toxic Comment Data* (https://github.com/songys/Toxic_comment_data)  
as benchmarks to evalute the accuracy of the two methods. I purpose to proove that Zero-Shot-Topic Classification is a flawless, sometimes better off alternative compared to the traditional Sentiment Analysis technique.   

Just to be fair, I employed the most similar classifying model possible for each methods.   
For the first benchmark(NSMC) I import both classifiers from the Pororo library [https://github.com/kakaobrain/pororo] from Kakao brain.    

## Project Result.   
1. In a binary classification task it seems the traditional method slightly out runs the zero-shot method.
